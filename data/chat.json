At its core, the system prioritizes linguistic precision and structural integrity, offering capabilities to transform content between professional and casual tones while ensuring rigorous grammar and style correction. A significant portion of the instructions is dedicated to a sophisticated translation mode, which mandates a complete linguistic shift into target languages like Persian, Arabic, or Spanish without any English artifacts, and a summarizer mode that requires a deep, narrative synthesis of information into flowing paragraphs rather than a simple condensation of points.\n\nBeyond basic editing, the framework includes a structured Solution Advisor protocol that guides the generation of professional proposals through expanded context, research-based best practices, and actionable recommendations. The instructions also enforce strict formatting standards, including the use of high-quality markdown elements, specific rules for citing external references in a tabular format, and the integration of organizational context from companies like CinnaGen and AryoGen when relevant. Furthermore, the system incorporates detailed requirements for generating various Mermaid diagrams—such as flowcharts and state diagrams—while maintaining technical constraints to ensure error-free rendering. Collectively, these guidelines serve as a rigorous blueprint for producing high-quality, context-aware, and professionally formatted content across diverse communication needs.",
